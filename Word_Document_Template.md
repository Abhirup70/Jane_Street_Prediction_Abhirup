## Project Background

Jane Street is a quantitative trading firm that uses algorithms and mathematical models for trading. In 2020, they hosted a Kaggle competition challenging participants to build models that predict profitable trading opportunities based on anonymized market data.

*[Insert image of the Jane Street Kaggle competition page]*

While the original competition has ended, this project creates a simplified version of the pipeline to demonstrate how such a system would work in practice.

## Dataset Overview

The project uses a sample of the Jane Street Market Prediction dataset, containing anonymized market data with the following characteristics:

- **Features**: 130 anonymized numerical features (feature_0 through feature_129)
- **Metadata**: date, ts_id, weight
- **Missing Values**: The dataset contains some missing values that need to be handled
- **Size**: 15,219 rows of data

*[Insert image showing a snapshot of the dataset with some sample rows]*

In a real trading scenario, these features might represent various market indicators, price movements, volume statistics, etc., but they've been anonymized for the competition.

## Detailed Component Explanations

### Data Download

The first step is to obtain the sample data for analysis and model training.

**Code Example:**
```python
import urllib.request
import os

# Create data directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs('data', exist_ok=True)

# URLs to download
urls = [
    "https://github.com/flame0409/Jane-Street-Market-Prediction/raw/master/example_test.csv",
    "https://github.com/flame0409/Jane-Street-Market-Prediction/raw/master/example_train.csv"
]

# Download files
for url in urls:
    filename = url.split('/')[-1]
    output_path = os.path.join('data', filename)
    print(f"Downloading {url} to {output_path}...")
    try:
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, output_path)
        print(f"Successfully downloaded {filename}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error downloading {filename}: {e}")
```

*[Insert image of terminal output showing successful download of files]*

**What this script does:**
- Creates a directory called `data/` to store our datasets
- Downloads sample data files from a GitHub repository
- Handles any download errors and reports them

### Data Exploration

Before building our model, we need to understand what the data looks like.

**Code Example:**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import os

# Load the dataset
data_path = 'data/example_test.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Display basic information
print(f"Dataset shape: {df.shape}")
print(f"Number of samples: {df.shape[0]}")
print(f"Number of features: {df.shape[1]}")

# Display the first few rows
print("\n=== First 5 rows of the dataset ===")
print(df.head())

# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print(f"Total missing values: {missing_values.sum()}")

# Plot missing values
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))
plt.bar(range(len(missing_values)), missing_values)
plt.xlabel('Feature Index')
plt.ylabel('Number of Missing Values')
plt.title('Missing Values in Each Feature')
plt.savefig('missing_values.png')
```

*[Insert image of a bar chart showing missing values by feature]*

*[Insert image of the first few rows of the dataset]*

**What this script does:**
- Loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
- Shows basic information about the dataset
- Displays the first few rows of data
- Checks for missing values
- Creates visualizations of the dataset characteristics

### Data Preprocessing

Raw data often needs to be cleaned and transformed before it can be used for training machine learning models.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Handle missing values
features_df = df[feature_cols]
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
features_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(features_df)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features_imputed)

# Visualize the effect of standardization
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.histplot(features_df.iloc[:, 0], kde=True)
plt.title('Before Standardization')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.histplot(features_scaled[:, 0], kde=True)
plt.title('After Standardization')
plt.savefig('standardization.png')
```

*[Insert image showing data distribution before and after standardization]*

**What this script does:**
- Separates feature columns from metadata columns
- Handles missing values by replacing them with column means
- Standardizes the features (making them have mean=0 and standard deviation=1)
- Splits the data into training and validation sets
- Visualizes the effect of the preprocessing steps

### Model Architecture

This section defines the neural network architectures we'll use for prediction.

**Code Example for MLP:**
```python
class JaneStreetMLP(nn.Module):
    """
    Multi-layer Perceptron model for Jane Street Market Prediction
    """
    def __init__(self, input_dim=130, hidden_dims=[256, 128, 64], dropout_rate=0.3):
        super(JaneStreetMLP, self).__init__()
        
        # Create layers
        layers = []
        prev_dim = input_dim
        
        # Hidden layers
        for dim in hidden_dims:
            layers.append(nn.Linear(prev_dim, dim))
            layers.append(nn.BatchNorm1d(dim))
            layers.append(nn.ReLU())
            layers.append(nn.Dropout(dropout_rate))
            prev_dim = dim
        
        # Output layer
        layers.append(nn.Linear(prev_dim, 1))
        
        # Combine layers
        self.model = nn.Sequential(*layers)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)
```

*[Insert diagram showing the MLP architecture with input, hidden layers, and output]*

**What this model does:**
- Takes 130 features as input
- Passes them through multiple hidden layers with decreasing sizes (256 → 128 → 64)
- Each hidden layer includes:
  - A linear transformation
  - Batch normalization
  - ReLU activation
  - Dropout for regularization
- Outputs a single value (probability of making a profitable trade)

### Model Training

This section handles the process of training our models on the preprocessed data.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Training loop
for epoch in range(args.epochs):
    print(f"\nEpoch {epoch + 1}/{args.epochs}")
    
    # Train and validate
    train_loss, train_acc, train_auc = train_epoch(model, train_loader, criterion, optimizer, device)
    val_loss, val_acc, val_auc = validate(model, val_loader, criterion, device)
    
    # Update history
    history['train_loss'].append(train_loss)
    history['val_loss'].append(val_loss)
    history['train_acc'].append(train_acc)
    history['val_acc'].append(val_acc)
    
    # Print statistics
    print(f"Train Loss: {train_loss:.4f}, Acc: {train_acc:.4f}, AUC: {train_auc:.4f}")
    print(f"Val Loss: {val_loss:.4f}, Acc: {val_acc:.4f}, AUC: {val_auc:.4f}")
    
    # Save best model
    if val_loss < best_val_loss:
        best_val_loss = val_loss
        save_model(model, best_model_path)
```

*[Insert image showing training progress with loss and accuracy curves]*

**What this script does:**
- Sets up the model, loss function, and optimizer
- Trains the model for a specified number of epochs
- For each epoch:
  - Trains the model on the training data
  - Validates on the validation set
  - Records metrics like loss, accuracy, and AUC
  - Saves the best model based on validation loss

### Model Evaluation

After training, we need to evaluate how well our model performs on data it hasn't seen during training.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Calculate confusion matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(all_targets, all_preds)

# Plot confusion matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', cbar=False,
            xticklabels=['Negative', 'Positive'],
            yticklabels=['Negative', 'Positive'])
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.savefig('confusion_matrix.png')

# Plot ROC curve
fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(all_targets, all_probs)
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=2, label=f'ROC curve (AUC = {roc_auc:.3f})')
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--')
plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])
plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.savefig('roc_curve.png')
```

*[Insert image of ROC curve showing model performance]*

**What this script does:**
- Loads a trained model
- Makes predictions on the validation dataset
- Calculates various performance metrics:
  - Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Generates visualizations:
  - Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve

### Making Predictions

Once we have a trained model, we can use it to make predictions on new data.

**Code Example:**
```python
# Make predictions
probabilities = predict_in_batches(model, features_scaled, args.batch_size, device)
predictions = (probabilities > args.threshold).astype(int)

# Add predictions to dataframe
df['probability'] = probabilities
df['prediction'] = predictions

# Save predictions
df.to_csv(output_path, index=False)

# Distribution of prediction probabilities
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(probabilities, bins=50, kde=True)
plt.axvline(x=args.threshold, color='red', linestyle='--', label=f'Threshold ({args.threshold})')
plt.xlabel('Probability')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Distribution of Prediction Probabilities')
plt.legend()
plt.savefig('probability_distribution.png')
```

*[Insert image showing the distribution of prediction probabilities]*

**What this script does:**
- Loads a trained model
- Preprocesses new data
- Makes predictions in batches
- Converts model outputs to probabilities and binary predictions
- Visualizes the distribution of prediction probabilities
- Saves the predictions to a CSV file

- Creating synthetic targets

*[Insert image of a roadmap for future improvements]*

**Future improvements could include:**
1. Feature engineering to create new features
2. Model ensembling to combine multiple models
3. Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance
4. Implementing a more realistic trading simulation

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the complete process of building a machine learning pipeline for market prediction:
1. Data collection and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
3. Model development and training
4. Model evaluation and prediction

The high accuracy and AUC scores suggest that our models can effectively learn patterns in the data. However, in real trading, many other factors would need to be considered, including transaction costs, market impact, and risk management.
